# iPhone-clone

> Working clones of iPhone widgets

### ❗️ Important

This is __not an emulator__ and __not a simulator__, it's just an __imitation of interaction__ with the __custom iPhone widgets__ I made myself via JS.
The performance and implementation of this project leaves much to be desired. This is __my old project__, but it's still __interesting__ and __deserves attention__.

### Description
    This project contains almost all the basic iPhone widgets and pages that you can interact with:
    ◼️ 39 Widgets
    ◼️ 58 Pages
    ◼️ Not all widgets have functionality, some of them are static
    
### What widgets you can interact with and what you can do
    ◼️ Check today's date and month in the "Calendar"
    ◼️ Viewing photos in the "Photos"
    ◼️ Switching camera mode in the "Camera"
    ◼️ disclose additional info in the "Maps"
    ◼️ Check the time, turn on alarms and bedtime in the "Clock"
    ◼️ Create and delete notes in the "Notes"
    ◼️ Create and delete reminders and scheduled tasks in the "Reminders"
    ◼️ Dial and erase a phone number in the "Phone"
    ◼️ Use calculator in the "Calculator"
    ◼️ Open "Extras" in order to see the widgets it has
    
Try to open all the widgets and who knows, maybe you will find something else? 🙂
