# iPhone-clone

> Remember what the iPhone was like in 2016

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Important ‚ùóÔ∏è

This is __not an emulator__ and __not a simulator__, it's just an __imitation of interaction__ with the __custom iPhone widgets__ I made myself via JS.
The performance and implementation of this project leaves much to be desired. This is __my old project__, but it's still __interesting__ and __deserves attention__

This project contains __almost all the basic iPhone widgets and pages__ that you can interact with

<ul>
