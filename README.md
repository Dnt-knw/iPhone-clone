# iPhone-clone

> Remember what the iPhone was like in 2016

### ‚ùóÔ∏è Important

This is __not an emulator__ and __not a simulator__, it's just an __imitation of interaction__ with the __custom iPhone widgets__ I made myself via JS.
The performance and implementation of this project leaves much to be desired. This is __my old project__, but it's still __interesting__ and __deserves attention__.

### Description
    This project contains almost all the basic iPhone widgets and pages that you can interact with:
    ‚óºÔ∏è 39 Widgets
    ‚óºÔ∏è 58 Pages
